        <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
        Pounded yam is a special dish peculiar to the Nigeria people of West Africa.

         Pounded yam can be enjoyed by varieties of traditional soups ranging from ogonno soup,
         oha soup, egusi soup, vegetable sout et ce tera.

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Yam (white yam preferably)</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>mortar and pistle or blender</li>
         </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            
            <li>Peel yam and cut in tiny pieces to help the blender.</li>
            <li>Add very few pieces to the blender with half a glass of water or less. The yam already has water in it ,
                 you just need very little water to enable the blender kick start.</li>
            <li>Blend till smooth, then you start adding more pieces gradually while blending. Continue to add until
                 it begins to thicken but don’t add any more water.</li>
            <li> blending, pour in a cooking pot, turn on the cooker and keep stirring like the way we make semo.</li>
            <li>stirring, when it begins to cook, there may be tiny lumps forming but don’t worry just continue stirring,
                 all the lumps will disappear when the poundo is ready. If it sticks to your turning stick, 
                 use a knife or spoon to clean them back into the pot and continue. 
                 A little vegetable oil on the turning stick will keep it from sticking there.</li>
            <li>When yam is ready in about 5 minutes of stirring, serve with any delicious soup and
                 enjoy with friends and family or just preserve your poundo in the freezer, microwave and enjoy when you are ready.</li>
